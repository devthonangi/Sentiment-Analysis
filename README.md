Sentiment Analysis of Text Data using Machine Learning and Ensemble Techniques
Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data extracted from social media posts, product reviews, and customer feedback using various machine learning algorithms and ensemble techniques. The goal is to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments to gain insights into customer perceptions, market trends, and public opinion.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and comprises Twitter data from the first GOP Debate. It includes attributes such as tweet text, sentiment labels, and other relevant metadata. The dataset is preprocessed to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and balance the class distribution using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn. It involves the following steps:

Data loading and preprocessing: Load the dataset, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and balance the dataset using SMOTE.
Feature engineering: Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
Model training and evaluation: Train multiple machine learning models including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest on the balanced dataset. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Ensemble learning: Implement a Voting Classifier to combine the predictions of individual models and improve overall performance.
Results
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble techniques in sentiment analysis, with the Voting Classifier achieving the highest accuracy among the models evaluated. The findings highlight the importance of addressing class imbalance and leveraging ensemble learning for accurate sentiment analysis of textual data.
